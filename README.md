*Zopfli Compression Algorithm is a new zlib (gzip, deflate) compatible
compressor. This compressor takes more time (~100x slower), but
compresses around 5% better than zlib and better than any other
zlib-compatible compressor we have found.*

Hopfli provides a pure interface to compress data using Zopfli algorithm.
